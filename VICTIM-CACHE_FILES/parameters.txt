we only changed assoc in the spec file, from either 16 or 64 for each run. 

our implementation still uses MSHR's for VC any miss no alloc so we kept mshrs at 8 and buffers at 4 for both runs

we directly edited the code assuming VC would be enabled and ignored mostly_excl
aside from baseline testing,

so to run our VC you just need the --enable-victim-cache flag to be enabled.
